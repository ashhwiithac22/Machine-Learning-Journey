# Regression Project  

## 📌 Overview  
This project demonstrates regression analysis using machine learning.  
The goal is to predict the target variable based on given features.  

## 📂 Dataset  
- The dataset used is stored in: `data/your_file.csv`  
- It contains features such as:  
  - Feature 1  
  - Feature 2  
  - Feature 3  
  - ...  

## ⚙️ Requirements  
Make sure you have the following installed:  

    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

## 🚀 Steps in the Project

1.Load the dataset (CSV file).

2.Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.

3.Explore data with visualization.

4.Split dataset into training and testing sets.

5.Apply regression models (Linear Regression, etc.).

6.Evaluate model performance using metrics such as R², MSE, RMSE.
